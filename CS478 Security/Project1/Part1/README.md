This foler contains two readme files. Readme.txt was created with the project and turned in along with the code. It explains how the code works as well as how I found the plaintext.

This program takes a ciphertext encrypted with a simple encryption and uses frequency distribution to establish an initial key. The user can then use this to find the plain text by finding additional letter matches.
