#DES implementation
#This folder contains two readme files. README.txt was created along with the project and was turned in with the code. It explains in detail how to use the program.

This program was written by a team of two. It can take a file named "input.txt" and encrypt it or take a file named "CIPHER.txt" and decrypt it depending on the command line input. The user can either provide a key and iv or use randomly generated values created by the program.
